Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This project serves as a digital resume and a showcase of my skills as a Software Engineer. It features a custom-built, highly interactive, dark-mode UI with a cyberpunk aesthetic.

## ✨ Key Features

This portfolio was built from scratch without any heavy frameworks, focusing on pure DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and interactive math.

* **System Boot Preloader:** A custom terminal-style boot sequence that initializes before revealing the site.
* **Matrix Digital Rain:** An always-on, customized `<canvas>` background running a highly optimized Matrix falling-code effect.
* **Custom Tracking Cursor:** A glowing teal dot with a trailing outer ring that expands when hovering over interactive elements.
* **3D Glassmorphism Tilt:** Profile and project cards calculate mouse position to physically tilt in 3D space (`perspective`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`) while casting dynamic shadows.
* **Scroll-Tracking Timeline:** A glowing neon line that lights up the "Education" and "Experience" nodes as the user scrolls down the page.
* **Cyberpunk Glitch Effect:** Pure CSS text-glitch animation on the main header.
* **Mermaid.js Integration:** Renders live, responsive system architecture flowcharts directly in the browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and layout.
* **CSS3:** Custom variables, flexbox/grid grids, keyframe animations, and 3D transforms.
